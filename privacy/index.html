    <h1>Nawa Application: Learn Arabic with AI - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 15/02/2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Nawa ("we," "us," or "our") is a language learning application that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help you learn Arabic. Our app connects to third-party AI services to provide personalised language lessons, translations, conversation practice, and feedback. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we collect it, how we use it, and with whom we share it — including our use of third-party AI services.</p>
    <p>By using Nawa, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. <strong>Before any of your data is sent to a third-party AI service, the app will ask for your explicit consent.</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following categories of data:</p>

    <h3>1.1 Data You Provide Directly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Text input and prompts:</strong> Words, phrases, sentences, and questions you type or speak into the app for translation, lesson generation, or conversation practice.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning preferences:</strong> Language proficiency level, lesson topics, and personalisation settings you configure in the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Data Collected Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Analytics data:</strong> Anonymous usage data such as app features used, time spent in the app, and interaction patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Device type, operating system version, and app configuration.</li>
        <li><strong>General location:</strong> Country or region-level location data (not precise GPS coordinates).</li>
        <li><strong>Performance metrics:</strong> Crash logs, error reports, and app performance data.</li>
        <li><strong>Log data:</strong> In the event of an error, we may collect log data including your device's IP address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, and timestamps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Collect Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct input:</strong> When you type or speak text into the app's learning features (e.g., translation requests, conversation practice, lesson prompts).</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic collection:</strong> Through analytics SDKs and system-level APIs that gather anonymous usage and device data while you use the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Error reporting:</strong> Through third-party crash-reporting tools when the app encounters an error.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>

    <h2>4. Data Shared with Third-Party AI Services</h2>
    <p><strong>Our app uses OpenAI's API services to power its AI-based language learning features.</strong> This section explains exactly what data is shared, who it is shared with, and how it is protected.</p>

    <h3>4.1 What Data Is Sent to OpenAI</h3>
    <p>When you use the app's AI-powered features (such as translation, conversation practice, or lesson generation), the following data may be sent to OpenAI:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Text input:</strong> The words, phrases, sentences, or questions you enter into the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning context:</strong> Your selected proficiency level and lesson topic, so the AI can tailor responses to your level.</li>
        <li><strong>Conversation history within a session:</strong> Previous messages in an active conversation thread, to maintain context during a learning session.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> send your name, email address, precise location, contacts, photos, or any other personal identifiers to OpenAI.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Who the Data Is Sent To</h3>
    <p>Your data is sent to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI, L.L.C.</strong> — headquartered in San Francisco, California, USA. OpenAI provides the large language model (LLM) API that powers the app's AI features. You can review OpenAI's privacy practices at <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://openai.com/privacy</a> and their API data usage policy at <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies</a>.</li>

    <h3>4.3 User Consent</h3>
    <p><strong>Before any of your data is transmitted to OpenAI, the app will present a clear consent prompt explaining what data will be shared and with whom. You must grant explicit permission before the app sends any data to OpenAI.</strong> If you do not consent, the AI-powered features of the app will not be available, but you may still access any offline or non-AI features.</p>
    <p>You may withdraw your consent at any time through the app's settings, which will stop any further data from being sent to OpenAI.</p>

    <h3>4.4 Third-Party Data Protection</h3>
